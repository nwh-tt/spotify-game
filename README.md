## Explanation

Game works just like the google higher or lower but is instead based on Spotify popularity score which is gathered from a Spotify api. If you think the song on the right is more popular you click more popular if you think it is less popular you click less popular

### What is popularity score?

The Spotify Popularity Index is a 0-to-100 score that ranks how popular a song is relative to other songs on Spotify.
